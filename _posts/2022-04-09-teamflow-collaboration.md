Teamflow was founded in August 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company raised $50M to develop a comprehensive virtual office product with tools akin to Microsoft Office, designed for remote teams. Teamflow envisioned combining features like chat, document sharing, and video conferencing into a single platform to help teams collaborate efficiently in a fully remote environment.

At the time, the product had around 1,000 users and was equipped with a basic virtual office interface, offering written chat and ad-hoc meetings (voice calls). However, it lacked critical features such as offline chat, scheduled meetings, and file collaboration (Word, Excel, etc.).


I joined TF in November 2021, about 15 months after the company's inception. My task was to integrate all the essential work tools—such as Slack-like chat, Zoom-like meetings, and shared documents—into TF, making it a one-stop solution for remote work.



During my first quarter, I focused on two main areas:

Conceptualizing Chat and Meeting Functions: I aimed to design a seamless, intuitive chat and meeting interface that could compete with popular tools like Slack and Zoom.
User Research and Investor Updates: I conducted user research with over 20 TF and Slack users to understand their pain points and expectations from a virtual office solution.
Key Findings from User Research: Users were reluctant to switch from popular tools like Slack and Zoom unless TF could offer similar functionalities.
Users appreciated the layout and design of the prototype but expressed skepticism about the necessity of switching platforms.
The initial concept lacked a compelling reason for users to migrate to TF.
Feedback from investors echoed this sentiment, highlighting that the business idea needed to be more thoroughly thought through.


Ultimately, the project was put on hold due to several factors:

User Feedback: The core concept wasn’t resonating with users as they were unwilling to switch from established tools like Slack and Zoom.
Market Stagnation: As more employees returned to physical offices, the demand for virtual office solutions began to decline, contributing to a slowdown in TF’s user base.

## Lessons Learned
I had reservations about the feasibility of competing with dominant tools like Slack and Zoom from the start. However, I still needed to gather user feedback to substantiate my skepticism. This experience reinforced the importance of balancing initial skepticism with a willingness to explore ideas fully.

**Investor Expectations:** As a new hire, I also had to navigate the pressures of delivering on promises made to investors, even when the task seemed flawed. This highlighted the tension between design vision and business commitments.

**Focus on Specialization:** A key takeaway was the realization that, for a 20-person startup, it would have been more promising to build a specialized tool that integrated with big players like Microsoft Teams, rather than trying to replicate their features.

## Conclusion
Although the project didn’t move forward, it provided valuable insights into the importance of understanding user needs, the competitive landscape, and the risks of trying to outcompete well-established platforms without offering distinctive, must-have features. For small startups, finding a niche and focusing on integration with established tools may be a more successful path than trying to recreate them from scratch.
