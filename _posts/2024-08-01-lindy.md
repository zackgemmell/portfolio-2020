When our team decided to pivot to Lindy.ai, the product was a fledgling idea: to create the ultimate AI personal assistant. It was a bold ambition—to build a conversational tool that could manage schedules, write emails, and coordinate with teams as naturally as chatting with a colleague. It was a bold leap, and as the founding designer, I was tasked with shaping how this revolutionary product would look, feel, and function.

Starting from scratch meant we had the freedom to question everything. What should an AI assistant look like? How should it communicate? How do we make it feel capable without being overwhelming?

I began with user research, sitting down with potential users to map out their pain points. What became clear was that trust would be our biggest design challenge. People needed to know that Lindy could handle their most important tasks without mistakes.

This insight shaped many of my early design decisions:

Transparency as a Feature: Every action Lindy took—whether drafting an email or scheduling a meeting—was previewed for user confirmation.
Control Through Conversation: Users could tweak and refine Lindy’s outputs in real-time, ensuring they always felt in control.
Building Personality: Small touches, like natural conversational tone and contextual explanations, made Lindy feel human and approachable.

## Reflections and Takeaways

Working on Lindy.ai taught me the importance of designing for trust and efficiency in AI-driven products. By focusing on user needs and iterating based on real feedback, we created an experience that felt both magical and reliable. This case study highlights how thoughtful design can make complex technology accessible and useful, transforming how people interact with AI in their daily lives.
