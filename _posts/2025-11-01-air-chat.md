Air Chat is an app that I built with a friend in 2012. The idea was to build an app that would allow people to chat with each other without a phone plan or when cell service was limited for instance on an airplane. Since it's release, the app has been downloaded  over 3M times as of 2025. Recently I decided to give it an update to bring it back up to modern standards for iOS 26 and to bring the app to macOS and visionOS as well.
