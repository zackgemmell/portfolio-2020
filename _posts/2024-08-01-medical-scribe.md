![An example of a retrospective]({{site.url}}/assets/img/ms/visit.png){: .post-image .img-120 .mt .mb .zoom-image }

The first iteration of the app gave users the ability to create public retros---anybody with the [link](https://ezretro.com/E0gysdEpPrxyO685zjQx) can contribute. It also provided the ability to vote on issues that other users wrote.

The next iteration added features that required authentication:

- Team management
- @mention teammates
- Admins controls

## ï£¿Watch app

The app was designed so that users would be able to conduct their patient visits conveniently with just their watch.
