With the rise of LLMs, we gained the ability to not only accurately transcribe medical conversations but also organize and structure them into patient notes, transforming one of the most tedious aspects of a clinician’s job into an almost effortless task. 

So I built an app. Give it a try at [medicalscribe.app](https://medicalscribe.app) or [download for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medical-scribe/id6482050489).

<!-- ## Watch app

The app was designed so that clinicians could conduct their patient visits with just their watch. -->
